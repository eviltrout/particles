Particles
=========
A simple Ruby/Gosu script for drawing particles into nice looking patterns. It might make a nice screen saver.

There's no license (besides Ruby/Gosu/etc), so feel free to use it however you want. If you do something cool with it, it would be nice to hear about it.

Installation/Dependencies/Running it:
=====================================
Particles needs Gosu installed. Gosu is available as a rubygem, so it should be as easy as saying:

sudo gem install gosu

Then you can run the script like so:

ruby particles.rb

I recommend you run it on Ruby 1.9.1 for the best performance. It seriously kicks the pants off Ruby 1.8.x.
